# Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java
This is a collection of my lab assignments for the course Object Oriented Programming (CS-504d). In this course, we came to know about the various OOP principles and how OOP can help us in getting a better design for our solution. We also came to know about how JAVA implements these OOP principles and what are the system defined packages and classes that help us in doing the same. We also learnt about UML and how to model real life problems.
